  opcode
    Opcode of the instruction

  signature
    Describes signature of the instruction. Properties of the operands are separated by '-' symbol.
    For info about operand tokens see the 'legend' section

    Note: any check instructions might be eliminated by optimizer, thus operand checks (nc, zc, bc, ngc) qualifiers have
          not mandatory meaning.

  base
    C++ base that represent this opcode. In far future if we managed to generate also instruction classes,
    this field become redundant

  flags
    Properties of the instruction, such as: arithmetic, binop, throw, etc

  modes
    Modes which the instruction can be used in

templates:
  # Templates aim to reduce boilerplate in instruction description.
  # Templates are denoted by a '$' symbol in the first character of the string.

    dyn: dynamic operands, means that operand can repeat zero or more times

verification:

    Type classes of instruction's operands are equal. Type classes are int, float, ref (see operand_tokens for info)
